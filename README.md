The Project Contains Two Folders:

1.WakeOnLan.xcodeproj-This Contains The Workspace files Of xcode Project

2.WakeOnLan - This contians the header file and c file of Wake On Lan.

This contains a c program named “main.c”and a header file named ”wakeOnLan.h”.This Program is designed to send Magic Packet to the Targeted Pc to turn it on.

Prerequisite:

Must turn on the wake on lan by going into the bios settings.

A lan wire must be connected to the target pc.

Mac Address and IP address are needed and can be found by going into the modem page, like 192.168.1.1/192.168.2.1,etc

How To Complie:

Open Terminal/cmd on the folder of the project.

gcc -Wall -o wol WakeOnLan/main.c

How To run:

Usage: ./wol [-r remoteaddress] [-f filename1, ...|mac1, ...]

You can either pass some MAC addresses or you can pass with the option f some filenames contains a MAC address on each line to wake up.
With the option r you can specify the remote ip address. The default value is 255.255.255.255 for a broadcast call.

Examples:

    $ ./wol 00:0B:CD:39:2D:E9 0E:FD:FA:33:5D:A6
    $ ./wol -r 192.168.1.36 00:0B:CD:39:2D:E9 0E:FD:FA:33:5D:A6 //Preferable
    $ ./wol -f macaddresses
    $ ./wol -r 192.168.1.36 -f macaddresses. 
    $ ./wol -f macaddresses macaddresses2

MAC address File Syntax:

The mac address syntax is very simple. It expects one mac address per line.
Lines starting with `#` are comment lines and will be ignored.

Valid Syntax:

    # Mac address of host 192.168.1.2
    00:0B:CD:39:2D:E9

    # Brothers mac address
    00:05:FE:AB:3D:99

    # Servers mac address
    00:32:D5:35:EF:63
